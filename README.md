<!-- To begin the game click the link in the button. It will take you to the game.

once im tha game you will use 'Z' and 'Left Arrow to control the chacracters.

Player 1 is 'left arrow' which is the character on the right side of the screen.

Player 2 is 'Z' which is the character on the left side of the screen.

tap 'z' or 'left arrow' to move the characters.

only tap slowly. I have not figured out how to completly stop them if the button is held down. There is a lag that wont let them stop.

IF YOU TAP AND ONE CHARACTER GETS TO THE OTHER SIDE IT WILL DISPLAY EITHER WINNER PLAYER 1 OR PLAYER 2.

REFRESH PAGE TO RESET GAME. -->
